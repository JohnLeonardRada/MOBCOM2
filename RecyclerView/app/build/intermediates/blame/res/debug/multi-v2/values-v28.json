</PRE>

<P>
An <CODE>XAQueueConnection</CODE> provides the same create options as 
 <CODE>QueueConnection</CODE> (optional).  
 The only difference is that an <CODE>XAConnection</CODE> is by definition 
 transacted.

<P>The <CODE>XAQueueConnection</CODE> interface is optional.  JMS providers 
 are not required to support this interface. This interface is for 
 use by JMS providers to support transactional environments. 
 Client programs are strongly encouraged to use the transactional support
 available in their environment, rather than use these XA
 interfaces directly.
