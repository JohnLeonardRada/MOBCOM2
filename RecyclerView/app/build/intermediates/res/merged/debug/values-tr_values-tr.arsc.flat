            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may

        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the
            path. You might want to use this if you want multiple versions
            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "roaming" (boolean, default False) can be set True to use the Windows
